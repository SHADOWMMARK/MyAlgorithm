# BASIC:
SELECT column_name,column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value;

# LIKE:
SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE conditions LIKE "m%";
#this will output table1's all row that the conditions start with "m"

# full outer join in MySQL:
(join the Employees and Salaries tables)
  (SELECT * FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id)
   UNION 
   SELECT * FROM Employees RIGHT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id))

#
UNION performs a DISTINCT on the result set, eliminating any duplicate rows.
UNION ALL does not remove duplicates, and it therefore faster than UNION.
