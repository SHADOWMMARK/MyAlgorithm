Here is some what is about mine thought in these algorithms:
while we know about recursion, but some time because it is top->down methods, that means in the rule of time it is not so efficient as down->top methods:
a little example of the dp al:
every one knows the  Fibonacci Number, here is my solution towards the leetcode prob 509:
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp=[0]*n
        if n==1:
            return 1
        elif n==0:
            return 0
        dp[0],dp[1]=1,1
        for i in range(2,n):
            dp[i]=dp[i-1]+dp[i-2]
        return dp[n-1]

and here is a classical problem in leetcode:
198. House Robber
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]
        dp = [0]*n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(dp[0],nums[1])
        for i in range(2,n):
            dp[i]=max(dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+nums[i])
        return dp[n-1]
        
And the other version of this problem:213. House Robber II:
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.
That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, andÂ it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
the solution is just to discuss two conditions: rob the first one or not. because there is a connection between the first and the last, so we cannot rob them both.
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 0:
          return 0
        if n <= 2:
          return max(nums)
        # not to rob the first one
        dp1 = [0] * n
        dp1[0] = 0
        dp1[1] = nums[1]
        for i in range(2, n):
          dp1[i] = max(dp1[i-1],nums[i] + dp1[i-2])

        # not to rob the last one
        dp2 = [0] * n
        dp2[0] = nums[0]
        dp2[1] = max(nums[0],nums[1])
        for i in range(2, n-1):
          dp2[i] = max(dp2[i-1],nums[i] + dp2[i-2])
        return max(dp1[n-1],dp2[n-2])
        
740. Delete and Earn
You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:
Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

Actually this problem can be convert into those two probs above, only by change the nums to another sequence list then it will help us a lot.

class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        nums.sort()
        numsap = []
        i = 0
        while i<len(nums):
            temp = nums.count(nums[i])
            numsap.append(temp)
            i+=temp
        n = len(numsap)
        dp = [0]*n
        dp[0] = nums[0]*numsap[0]
        if n == 1:
            return dp[0]
        k = numsap[0]
        if nums[k] ==  nums[0]+1:
            dp[1] = max(dp[0],nums[k]*numsap[1])
        else:
            dp[1] = dp[0]+nums[k]*numsap[1]
        i,t = 2,numsap[0]
        k = numsap[0]+numsap[1]
        while i < n:
            if nums[k] == nums[t] + 1:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+nums[k]*numsap[i])
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1]+nums[k]*numsap[i]
            t += numsap[i-1]
            k += numsap[i]
            i += 1
        return dp[n-1]
