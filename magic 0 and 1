python notation:a|b means the a and b or by bit:
example a =100 b= 001 a|b=101

Presented with the integer n,
find the 0-based position of the second rightmost zero bit in its binary representation
(it is guaranteed that such a bit exists), counting from right to left.

def solution(n):
    return ((n+1|n)+1|n)-n
    
not so clear why doing this,
wait explaination later.
